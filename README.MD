## 👨‍💻 About Me  

I’m a **BCA student at IGNOU** and a passionate developer who loves solving problems through code and building impactful digital solutions.  
I combine my strong programming foundation with hands-on development experience to learn and implement modern technologies.  

Currently, I’m sharpening my **DSA skills in C++**, enhancing my **Full-Stack Web Development** expertise, and exploring **AI/ML concepts** to integrate intelligence into applications.  

I have prior experience in **Custom ROM development**, where I contributed to unofficial builds, learned advanced Git/GitHub workflows, and gained deep understanding of device trees, kernels, vendor packages, and build systems. This experience taught me real-world problem-solving, collaboration in open-source communities, and persistence in learning new technologies.  

- 🌱 **Learning Full-Stack Development** at *Sheryians Coding School (Job Ready Cohort 2.0)*  
- 📚 **Mastering Data Structures & Algorithms (C++)** at *PW Skills* (completed 2D vectors, arrays, recursion, and more)  
- 🔭 Upcoming focus: **React, Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js, System Design**  
- 💡 Vision: **Launch a tech-driven company** with global impact  
- ✍️ Sharing my learning journey here on GitHub — from **foundations to advanced projects**, documenting everything for continuous growth
